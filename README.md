You: I have headache
```
```
DOCTOR: To understand your symptoms better, I need a few more details:
- When did you first start experiencing headaches?
- Can you describe the nature of your headache (e.g., throbbing, sharp, constant, intermittent)?
- Have you noticed any pattern or triggers associated with your nausea?
- What type of visual disturbances are you experiencing? Are they flashes, blurriness, floating spots, or something else?
- Have you vomited only once or multiple times? Does it occur before, during, or after the headache?
- Do you have any history of migraines or other known conditions that could be related to your symptoms?
```
```

DOCTOR: Next clarification question:
- Do you have any history of migraines or other known conditions that could be related to your symptoms?
```
```
You: high blood pressure
```
```
DOCTOR: I'm really sorry that you are experiencing a headache. Headaches can have multiple causes and it's important to understand the possible reasons for your symptoms, especially when they last for more than a day or two.
Firstly, one of the potential reasons could be high blood pressure. Prolonged high blood pressure can lead to tension-type headaches, which can feel sharp o r persistent.
Another possibility is stress or fatigue, as these conditions can also trigger headaches. However, if your headache comes with other symptoms like nausea, omiting, vision changes, or an unusual sensitivity to light, it might be a sign of migraines.
